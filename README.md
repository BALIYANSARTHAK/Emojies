# Random Emoji Generator

This is a simple web application that displays a random emoji when the user hovers over it.

- Simple and lightweight design.

## Technologies Used

- **CSS**: Styling and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the emoji randomization logic.

## How It Works
1. The webpage initially displays an emoji (`ü§ë`).
2. When the user hovers over the emoji, a JavaScript function selects a random emoji from a predefined array.
3. The emoji changes, and a smooth scaling effect is applied.
